# Introduction of Book
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It uses a set of tags and attributes to define the elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to add styling and layout to web pages. It allows developers to control the visual appearance of HTML elements, including their size, color, font, spacing, and positioning.
JavaScript is a programming language used to add dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to create interactive elements and manipulate the content of a web page in response to user actions or events.
Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a secure and stable platform for building server-side applications in JavaScript or TypeScript, without requiring any additional tooling or libraries. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine and offers features such as built-in testing and debugging tools, module loading, and a built-in package manager.

It also discusses the tools and technologies used by each type of developer.
 


# Chapter2: HTML Basics
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used to create and structure web pages. HTML uses tags to define the structure of a document, including text, images, links, and other content elements.
Introduction to HTML: HTML is a markup language that is used to structure content on the web. It provides a standardized way of creating web pages that can be easily understood and interpreted by web browsers.
HTML elements and attributes: HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page, and they are used to define the structure and content of a document. HTML attributes provide additional information about an element, such as its size, color, or behavior.
HTML Document Structure and Semantics: HTML documents have a defined structure that includes a head and a body section. The head section contains metadata about the document, while the body section contains the actual content that is displayed to the user. HTML also provides a set of semantic elements that are used to describe the meaning and structure of content, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists.
# Chapter3: CSS Basics
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. Here is a brief overview of the topics you mentioned:
Introduction to CSS:
CSS allows web developers to separate the presentation of a document from its structure. This separation makes it easier to maintain the look and feel of a website across multiple pages, as changes can be made to the CSS file rather than having to update each individual HTML file.
CSS selectors and precedence:
Selectors in CSS are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are several types of selectors in CSS, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. Precedence refers to the order in which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules apply to the same element.
CSS Box Model and Layout:
The CSS box model refers to the way in which HTML elements are represented as rectangular boxes, which can be styled using CSS properties. The box model includes the content area, padding, borders, and margins. The layout of a website refers to the way in which these boxes are arranged on a page, which can be controlled using CSS properties such as display, position, and float.
# Chapter4: JavaScript Basics
Introduction to JavaScript: JavaScript is a popular programming language used for developing web applications. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's computer or browser rather than on the web server. JavaScript allows developers to add dynamic and interactive features to their web pages, making them more engaging for users.
JavaScript syntax and data types: JavaScript has a syntax that is similar to other programming languages. It uses variables, operators, and functions to manipulate data and perform operations. JavaScript has several data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, and objects. Variables in JavaScript can be declared using the keywords "var", "let", or "const".
JavaScript functions and scope: Functions are a key concept in JavaScript. They allow developers to write reusable code and organize their programs into smaller, more manageable pieces. Functions in JavaScript can take arguments, return values, and be nested within other functions. JavaScript also has a concept called scope, which refers to the visibility of variables and functions within a program. Variables declared inside a function have a local scope, while variables declared outside of a function have a global scope.
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

•	required attribute: Allows developers to require users to fill out certain fields in a form before submitting it.
•	autofocus attribute: Allows developers to automatically focus on a specific input field when the page is loaded.
•	pattern attribute: Allows developers to specify a regular expression pattern that input values must match.
•	media attribute: Allows developers to specify different media types for a resource, such as audio, video, or images, and the appropriate resources will be loaded based on the user's device capabilities.
Overall, HTML5 introduces many new features that make it easier for developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages, while also improving accessibility and multimedia support.

# Chapter7: HTML Tags and Attributes
HTML tags are used to define the content and structure of a web page. HTML tags are surrounded by angle brackets, and most come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of a web page is placed between the opening and closing tags.
HTML attributes provide additional information about an HTML element, and are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element. Attributes are added to an opening tag and take the form of name-value pairs.
HTML elements are classified into two main categories: block-level and inline-level. Block-level elements create a new block on the page, and take up the full width of their container. Examples of block-level elements include headings, paragraphs, and divs. Inline-level elements are placed within a block-level element, and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples of inline-level elements include spans, links, and images.
HTML also includes semantic tags, which are used to define the meaning or purpose of the content, rather than just the appearance. Examples of semantic tags include header, footer, article, section, and nav. Using semantic tags helps to improve the accessibility and search engine optimization of a web page.
HTML also provides a basic structure for a web page, with the use of the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. The <html> tag is used to define the document as an HTML document, and contains the <head> and <body> tags. The <head> tag is used to provide information about the document, such as the title and metadata. The <body> tag contains the visible content of the web page.
# Chapter8: HTML Forms
HTML forms are used to collect information from website visitors. They allow users to enter data and interact with a website. HTML forms contain a variety of input fields, such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and more.
Here are the types of form elements that you can use in HTML:
1.	Text fields: Text fields allow users to enter text, numbers, or other data. They are often used for things like usernames, passwords, and search fields.
2.	Radio buttons: Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list of choices. They are often used for things like gender or preference selection.
3.	Checkboxes: Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a list of choices. They are often used for things like terms and conditions or newsletter subscriptions.
4.	Drop-down lists: Drop-down lists allow users to select one option from a list of choices. They are often used for things like country or state selection.
5.	Textareas: Textareas allow users to enter large amounts of text, such as comments or messages.
6.	Buttons: Buttons can be used to submit a form or perform other actions, such as resetting the form or clearing the input fields.
To use these form elements, you need to specify their attributes. Some common attributes for form elements include:
 •	Name: This attribute specifies the name of the input field. It is used to identify the data entered by the user.
 •	Value: This attribute specifies the value of the input field. It is used to prefill the input field with default values.
 •	Required: This attribute specifies whether the input field is required or not. If set to "true", the user cannot submit the form without entering data into the field.
 •	Placeholder: This attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of the input field.
Once a user submits a form, the data is usually validated on the server-side before being processed. Validation can include checking for required fields, checking for valid data types, and checking for malicious input.
Overall, HTML forms are a powerful tool for collecting data from website visitors and interacting with them in meaningful ways.
# Chapter9: HTML Multimedia
HTML provides several elements for multimedia content, including images, audio, and video. These elements can be used to enrich the content of a webpage and make it more engaging for users.
Images
Images can be added to an HTML page using the <img> element. This element requires a src attribute, which specifies the URL of the image file. You can also use the alt attribute to provide alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded, and the title attribute to provide additional information about the image.
Here's an example of how to add an image to an HTML page:
PHP

<<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape" title="Photo by John Smith">>  
Audio
HTML5 introduced the <audio> element for embedding audio content in web pages. The src attribute specifies the URL of the audio file, and the element can also include other attributes like controls, autoplay, and loop.
Here's an example of how to add an audio element to an HTML page:
CSS
<audio src="music.mp3" controls></audio>
Video
The <video> element can be used to embed video content in web pages. It requires a src attribute to specify the URL of the video file, and can include other attributes like controls, autoplay, and loop.
Here's an example of how to add a video element to an HTML page:
CSS
<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
Other Multimedia Resources
In addition to images, audio, and video, HTML also allows for embedding other multimedia resources like embedded content from other websites, such as YouTube videos or social media posts. You can do this using the <iframe> element.
Here's an example of how to embed a YouTube video in an HTML page:
Aurdino
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Note that when embedding multimedia resources from other websites, you may need to comply with their terms of service or obtain permission before doing so.
# Chapter10: HTML Layout and Structure
HTML Layout and Structure: HTML provides a basic structure for creating web pages, which can be styled and arranged using CSS. The basic structure of an HTML document consists of a head and a body. The head section contains information about the document, such as the title, and the body section contains the content of the document.
HTML provides a number of elements that can be used to structure and organize the content of a web page. These elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms. By using these elements in combination with CSS, it is possible to create complex layouts and structures for web pages.
CSS provides a number of layout methods and related properties that can be used to position and arrange elements on a web page. These include properties such as display, position, float, and clear, as well as layout methods such as grid, flexbox, and float.
Responsive web design is a design approach that aims to create web pages that look good and work well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. This can be achieved by using CSS techniques such as media queries, which allow different styles to be applied to a page based on the size of the screen.
Flexbox is a layout method in CSS that provides a flexible way to arrange and align elements on a web page. With flexbox, it is possible to create complex layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Flexbox provides a number of properties that can be used to control the size, spacing, and alignment of elements.
Part Three: CSS
# Chapter11: What's New in CSS3
CSS3 is the latest version of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language. It introduces several new features and enhancements over its previous version, CSS2. Some of the new features in CSS3 are:
1.	Selectors: CSS3 introduces several new selectors, such as attribute selectors, structural pseudo-classes, and negation pseudo-class, which allow you to select and style elements more precisely.
2.	Box Model: CSS3 introduces the box-sizing property, which allows you to specify how an element's width and height are calculated, including the padding and border. It also introduces the border-radius property, which allows you to create rounded corners.
3.	Gradients: CSS3 introduces support for linear and radial gradients, allowing you to create complex background effects.
4.	Animations and Transitions: CSS3 introduces several new properties and values for creating animations and transitions, such as transition, transform, and animation. These properties allow you to create smooth and fluid animations without the need for JavaScript.
5.	Media Queries: CSS3 introduces media queries, which allow you to apply different styles to different devices or screen sizes. This is essential for creating responsive web designs that look great on any device.
6.	Font properties: CSS3 introduces several new font properties, including font-face and font-size-adjust, which allow you to use custom fonts and adjust the font size based on the aspect ratio of the device.
7.	Multiple backgrounds: CSS3 allows you to add multiple background images to an element, which can be layered and positioned independently.
Overall, CSS3 provides web developers with more powerful and flexible tools for creating rich, interactive, and responsive web designs.
# Chapter12: CSS Selectors and Precedence
CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements for styling. There are several types of CSS selectors, including:
1.	Element selectors: Targeting HTML elements by their tag name, such as p, h1, div, etc.
2.	Class selectors: Targeting elements with a specific class attribute value, denoted by a . followed by the class name, such as .my-class.
3.	ID selectors: Targeting elements with a specific ID attribute value, denoted by a # followed by the ID name, such as #my-id.
4.	Attribute selectors: Targeting elements with a specific attribute value, denoted by square brackets [], such as [type="submit"].
5.	Pseudo-classes: Targeting elements with a specific state or position, denoted by a colon :, such as :hover, :active, :nth-child(), etc.
6.	Pseudo-elements: Targeting specific parts of an element, such as the first letter or line of text, denoted by double-colons ::, such as ::first-letter, ::before, ::after, etc.
CSS selectors have different levels of specificity, which determine the priority of one selector over another when multiple selectors apply to the same element. The specificity is calculated based on the number and types of selectors used in each selector, with higher specificity taking precedence over lower specificity.
For example, an ID selector has a higher specificity than a class selector, which has a higher specificity than an element selector. Inline styles have the highest specificity, as they are directly applied to the element.
It's important to note that using more specific selectors can increase the complexity of the CSS code and make it harder to maintain. It's generally recommended to use more general selectors whenever possible and to avoid using inline styles.

# Chapter13: CSS Box Model and Layout
The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that defines how every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box. This box consists of four regions: content, padding, border, and margin.
The content area is where the actual content of the element, such as text, images, and other media, is displayed. The padding area is the space between the content and the border. The border area is the border surrounding the content and padding. Finally, the margin area is the space between the border and any adjacent elements.
Each of these regions has its own properties, which can be adjusted with CSS. For example, the padding property controls the size of the padding area, while the border property controls the thickness and style of the border.
The display mode property is used to specify how an element should be displayed on the web page. The default value is "block", which means that the element takes up the full width of its parent container and starts on a new line. Other values include "inline", "inline-block", "flex", and "grid".
The position property is used to specify how an element should be positioned within its parent container. The default value is "static", which means that the element is positioned according to its place in the HTML document flow. Other values include "relative", "absolute", and "fixed". When used with the top, bottom, left, and right properties, the position property can be used to precisely position elements on a web page.
# Chapter14: CSS Text and Fonts
CSS provides a variety of properties and methods for styling text on a webpage. Some of the commonly used properties and methods of CSS text are:
1.	color: This property is used to set the color of the text.
2.	font-family: This property is used to set the font family for the text.
3.	font-size: This property is used to set the font size for the text.
4.	font-weight: This property is used to set the weight (boldness) of the font.
5.	text-align: This property is used to set the alignment of the text.
6.	text-decoration: This property is used to set the decoration of the text, such as underline or strikethrough.
7.	text-transform: This property is used to set the capitalization of the text.
8.	line-height: This property is used to set the height of each line of text.
In addition to these properties, CSS provides a number of other text-related properties, such as letter-spacing, word-spacing, text-shadow, and text-overflow, among others.
When it comes to fonts, CSS allows you to specify a variety of font-related properties, including font-family, font-size, font-style, font-weight, line-height, and text-transform, among others. CSS also provides the @font-face rule, which allows you to use custom fonts on your webpage.
Google Fonts is a popular web service that provides a large collection of free, open-source fonts that you can use on your website. To use Google Fonts, you simply need to include a link to the font in the <head> section of your HTML document, and then specify the font family in your CSS code.
Custom fonts can also be used in CSS by including the font files in your website's directory, and then using the @font-face rule to specify the font family and font file paths in your CSS code.
# Chapter15: CSS Backgrounds and Gradients
CSS backgrounds and gradients are an essential part of creating visually appealing and engaging websites. Here's a brief overview of these topics:
1.	CSS Backgrounds:
The background of an element in CSS can be styled using various properties, such as background-color, background-image, background-repeat, background-position, and background-size. These properties allow you to add color, images, patterns, and textures to the background of an element.
Here's an example of setting a background color:
CSS
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;}
And here's an example of setting a background image:
CSS
div {
  background-image: url('image.png');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
}
2.	CSS Gradients:
CSS gradients allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more colors. There are two types of gradients: linear and radial.
Here's an example of setting a linear gradient:
CSS
div {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #ff8a00, #e52e71); }
And here's an example of setting a radial gradient:
CSS
div {
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center, #ff8a00, #e52e71);
}
3.	Advanced Effects and Applications:
Using CSS backgrounds and gradients, you can create various advanced effects, such as:
•	Parallax scrolling backgrounds
•	Overlay color and image effects
•	Gradient text effects
•	Gradients as borders and outlines
•	Background animations and transitions
These effects can add depth, dimension, and interactivity to your website design, making it more engaging and memorable for the users.


# Chapter16: CSS Adaptive Design
CSS Adaptive Design, also known as responsive web design, is a design approach that focuses on creating websites that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This is accomplished through the use of CSS media queries, which allow developers to apply different styles to a page based on the size of the viewport.
Media queries are written in CSS and allow you to specify different styles based on the size of the viewport. For example, you can create a media query that applies a specific style to a page when the viewport is less than 768 pixels wide, and another style when it is greater than 768 pixels wide.
Media queries can be used to adjust a variety of properties, including font size, column width, and layout. They can also be used to hide or show certain elements on the page based on the viewport size.
An example of adaptive design based on media queries might include a website that has a three-column layout on large screens, but switches to a single-column layout on smaller screens. This could be achieved through the use of media queries that adjust the width of the columns based on the size of the viewport.
Overall, CSS adaptive design is an important technique for creating websites that are accessible and usable on a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
Part Four: JavaScript
# Chapter17: JavaScript DOM Manipulation
The DOM is a programming interface for web documents, which represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. In other words, it is a tree-like structure of HTML elements, also called nodes, that can be manipulated using JavaScript.
DOM manipulation is a common task in web development, as it allows developers to dynamically change the content, style, and behavior of a web page in response to user actions, data input, or other events.
Here are some common methods and techniques for DOM manipulation in JavaScript:
1.	Accessing elements: The getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector methods can be used to access specific HTML elements in the DOM.
2.	Modifying elements: Once an element has been accessed, its properties can be modified using the innerHTML, textContent, setAttribute, and style properties.
3.	Creating new elements: New HTML elements can be created and added to the DOM using the createElement and appendChild methods.
4.	Event handling: JavaScript can be used to add event listeners to elements, such as click, mouseover, or submit, and to perform actions in response to those events.
5.	Traversing the DOM: The DOM is a hierarchical structure of elements, and JavaScript can be used to traverse the tree and access parent, child, and sibling elements.
Here is an example of using the DOM API to change the content of a webpage:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>DOM Manipulation Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1 id="heading">Welcome to my website</h1>
	<p id="paragraph">Click the button to change the heading text</p>
	<button id="button">Change Heading</button>
	<script>
		// access the button element and add an event listener
		document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function() {
			// access the heading element and change its text
			document.getElementById("heading").innerHTML = "New Heading Text";
		});
	</script>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the JavaScript code adds an event listener to the button element that changes the text content of the heading element when the button is clicked. This is a simple example, but it demonstrates the basic principles of DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
# Chapter18: JavaScript Event Handling
JavaScript event handling refers to the ability to handle events, or user actions, on a web page using JavaScript. Events can include things like clicking a button, scrolling the page, or submitting a form. When an event occurs, JavaScript can be used to execute code in response to the event.
The event model in JavaScript involves three main components: the event target, the event listener, and the event object. The event target is the object on the web page that triggers the event. The event listener is the code that is executed in response to the event. The event object contains information about the event, such as the target element and any data associated with the event.
To handle events in JavaScript, you can use event listeners. An event listener is a piece of code that waits for a specific event to occur and then executes a function in response to the event. There are several methods for attaching event listeners to HTML elements, including the addEventListener() method and the onEventName property.
Common event types in JavaScript include click, mouseover, keypress, and submit. For example, you can attach an event listener to a button element that executes a function when the button is clicked:
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>

<script>
  const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  });
</script>
In this example, an event listener is attached to the button element using the addEventListener() method. The listener function displays an alert when the button is clicked.
Overall, event handling is an important part of web development, and JavaScript provides powerful tools for handling user actions on a web page.
# Chapter19: JavaScript Object Orientation
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. In OOP, everything is an object that has properties and methods. JavaScript is a prototype-based object-oriented language, which means that objects are created by copying properties and methods from other objects.
In JavaScript, objects are created using constructors or classes. A constructor is a function that is used to create objects. The new keyword is used to create an instance of an object using a constructor. Classes were introduced in ES6 and provide syntactic sugar for creating objects using a constructor.
Prototyping is a core concept in JavaScript's object-oriented programming model. When an object is created in JavaScript, it has a hidden link to another object called its prototype. This prototype is used to provide default values and methods to the object. If a property or method is not found in the object itself, it will be searched for in the prototype chain until it is found or until the end of the chain is reached.
Object-oriented programming in JavaScript can be achieved through a number of methods, including:
1.	Object literals: Objects can be created using object literals, which are a comma-separated list of name-value pairs enclosed in curly braces.
2.	Constructors: Constructors are functions that are used to create objects. Constructors are typically named with an initial capital letter to distinguish them from regular functions.
3.	Classes: Classes were introduced in ES6 and provide a syntactic sugar for creating objects using constructors.
Here is an example of creating an object using a constructor:
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

var person1 = new Person("John", 30);
In this example, the Person function is used as a constructor to create an object called person1. The name and age properties are set using the constructor's parameters.
JavaScript also provides a number of built-in objects that can be used in object-oriented programming, including Array, Date, and Math. These objects have properties and methods that can be accessed and used to perform various operations.
# Chapter20: JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks
JavaScript libraries and frameworks are widely used by developers to simplify their work and increase productivity. These libraries and frameworks provide pre-written code and functionalities for common tasks, allowing developers to focus on the unique aspects of their project.
Some commonly used JavaScript libraries and frameworks include:
1.	jQuery - a popular library used for simplifying DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.
2.	React - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides efficient rendering through the use of a virtual DOM.
3.	Vue.js - a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js allows for the creation of interactive and reactive UI components, and its lightweight size makes it easy to integrate into existing projects.
4.	AngularJS - a popular framework for building web applications. AngularJS provides two-way data binding and dependency injection, making it easy to manage complex applications.
When using libraries and frameworks, it's important to read the documentation thoroughly and understand how to properly integrate the code into your project. It's also important to keep the library or framework up-to-date to ensure compatibility with other dependencies and security patches.

deno repl
This command starts the Deno REPL, where you can enter JavaScript or TypeScript code and see the output in real time.
4.	To run a Deno script with specific permissions, use the --allow flag followed by the required permission. For example:
arduino
deno run --allow-read app.js
This command allows the app.js script to read files from the file system.
How to Compile and Run Deno: Deno is a runtime, so there is no need to compile Deno itself. To compile and run Deno scripts, you simply need to have Deno installed on your machine and run your scripts using the deno run command, as shown above.
To install Deno, you can use the following command:
ruby
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
This command installs Deno using the shell script provided by the Deno team. Alternatively, you can also install Deno using a package manager like Homebrew (for macOS and Linux) or Chocolatey (for Windows). Once installed, you can verify that Deno is working correctly by running the following command:
CSS
deno –version
This command should display the version number of the Deno runtime.
# Chapter22: Deno Modules and Dependencies
Deno provides a built-in module system that allows developers to easily import and use external modules and dependencies. In Deno, modules are identified by a URL, which can be a remote URL or a local file path.
To import a module in Deno, you can use the import keyword followed by the URL of the module:
JavaScript
import { someFunction } from 'https://example.com/some-module.ts';
Deno also supports importing modules from local files:
JavaScript
import { someFunction } from './some-module.ts';
When you import a module in Deno, it is automatically downloaded and cached on the local machine. If the same module is imported again, Deno will use the cached copy instead of downloading it again.
Deno also provides a mechanism for managing dependencies using a file called deps.ts. This file can be used to specify the dependencies of your project and their versions:
JavaScript
export { someFunction } from 'https://example.com/some-module.ts';
export { someOtherFunction } from 'https://example.com/some-other-module.ts';
To install the dependencies specified in deps.ts, you can use the deno cache command:
Bash
deno cache --lock=lock.json deps.ts
This will download and cache the dependencies specified in deps.ts. The --lock option is used to create a lock file that records the versions of the dependencies that were downloaded.
Deno also supports advanced features such as importing modules from TypeScript files, importing modules from GitHub repositories, and more. Overall, Deno's module and dependency management system is flexible and powerful, making it easy to manage and use external libraries and modules in your projects.
# Chapter23: Deno Web Application Development
Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is built on top of V8 and Rust. It provides a secure and efficient environment for developing web applications. Here are some basic concepts and tools for Deno web application development:
1.	HTTP Server: Deno provides an HTTP server module in the standard library that can be used to create web applications. The HTTP server can be created using the serve() method and can listen on a specific port for incoming requests.
2.	Web Frameworks: There are several web frameworks available for Deno, including Oak, Attain, ABC, and Drash. These frameworks provide additional features and functionality for building web applications.
3.	Third-Party Modules: Deno allows developers to use third-party modules and dependencies in their web applications. These modules can be installed and managed using the built-in module system.
4.	Middleware: Middleware is a function that is executed in between the request and response in a web application. It is used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling. Deno provides middleware functionality through web frameworks like Oak.
5.	Templating Engines: Templating engines are used to generate dynamic HTML content based on data from the server. There are several templating engines available for Deno, including Pug, EJS, and Handlebars.
6.	Database Connectivity: Deno supports various database connectors for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc. through third-party modules.
7.	Deployment: There are several ways to deploy Deno web applications, including using cloud services like AWS or Heroku, deploying to a VPS, or using a Deno-specific deployment platform like Deno Deploy.
